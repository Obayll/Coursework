Step1 #1)
	How many errors appear? 17
	How many warnings appear? 4

Step #3)
	Run the program, and at the prompt, enter the value 10.
	What happens? The program asks for numbers of rolls to do, rolls a dice, displays the roll, asks user to continue, then quits.

	How many times did the program roll the dice? 1 time.
	How many times did you anticipate the program to roll? 10 times.

Step #4)
	How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? 1 time.
	List the values output by the printf statement you added: i = 10
 
	Compile and run the code again (using 10 as input). Did the warning message go away? Yes.

Now answer the following questions:
	How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? 1 time.
	List the values output by the printf statement you added: i = 10

Comment out the for loop, and copy it to the line below, this time without the semicolon.
Compile and run the program again (using 10 as input). Now answer the questions:
	How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? 2 times.
	List the values output by the printf statement you added: i = 1 , i = 2 , i = 3 , i = 4 , i = 5 , i = 6 , i = 7 , i = 8 , i = 9

	How many times have you been rolling the dice? 9 times.

Compile and run the code again (using 10 as input):
Answer the following questions:
	How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? 10 times.
	List the values output by the printf statement you added: i = 1 , i = 2 , i = 3 , i = 4 , i = 5 , i = 6 , i = 7 , i = 8 , i = 9 , i = 10

Step #5:
Answer the following questions:
	How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? 11 times.
	List the values output by the printf statement you added: i = 0 , i = 1 , i = 2 , i = 3 , i = 4 , i = 5 , i = 6 , i = 7 , i = 8 , i = 9 , i = 10
 

Change back to i=1, and recompile, and run the code. Answer the following questions:
	How many times does the printf statement you added get executed? 10 times.
	List the values output by the printf statement you added: i = 1 , i = 2 , i = 3 , i = 4 , i = 5 , i = 6 , i = 7 , i = 8 , i = 9 , i = 10

Step #6:  
	List the function calls and their corresponding include files other than main and return:
	printf(): stdio.h
	scanf(): stdio.h
	getchar(): stdio.h
	system(): stdlib.h
	srandom(): stdlib.h
	random(): stdlib.h
	time(): time.h

	Briefly explain what does the program do: The program takes a number from the user and rolls a dice with 6 sides for how many times the user specified. The program displays each roll and asks the user for any character input before next roll is calculated and shown.
